Valentine
=========

Will you be mine?


## About

_Original project: [github.com/SkylerJaneClark/valentine](https://github.com/SkylerJaneClark/valentine)_

Simple Python script to make a pretty display and say some nice words. Uses
[Turtle graphics](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) to draw shapes.


## Installation

### Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
```

### Debian / Ubuntu / Mint / etc.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-tkinter
```


## Usage

Happily cross-compatible between Python 2.7 and Python 3.6.

```

Execute the script like you would any other Python file.
